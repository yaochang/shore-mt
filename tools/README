CONVENTIONS for generating code:

1) Generated files will have names whose
	base part (without extension) is _gen
	and whose extension is .h, cpp
    --> this helps in 2 ways: 1) under VC++(dev studio)
	you can view these files with all the coloring
	and type browsing support, and 2) you can easily
	identify generated files by name.

2) Generated files will contain a comment at the top
	to the effect that this is a generated file, e.g.,

	/* DO NOT EDIT --- GENERATED from $file by errors.pl */
