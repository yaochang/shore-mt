/**\defgroup SSMINIT Starting Up, Shutting Down, Thread Context

 * Starting the Storage Manager consists in 2 major things:
 * - Initializing the options the storage manager expects to be set.
 *   This can get rather complicated, but fortunately we offer example
 *   code.  See \ref SSMOPT and \ref SSMVAS.
 * - Constructing an instance of the class ss_m.
 *   The constructor performs recovery, and when it returns to the caller,
 *   the caller may begin using the storage manager.  
 *
 * \attention No more than one instance may exist at any time.
 * \attention Storage manager functions must be called in the context of
 * a run() method of an smthread_t. 
 *
 * Shutting down the storage manager consists of deleting the instance
 * of ss_m created above.

/**\defgroup SSMFILE Files of Records
 * \ingroup SSMSTG
 * You can create, destroy, and scan files of records. You may exert some
 * control over the order in which records appear in the file (a physical
 * scan), but, in general, the storage manager decides where to put records.
 *
 * Pages in a file are slotted pages: Each page contains an array of
 * slots.
 * Records take one of three forms: small, large, and very large.
 * - Small records fit in the slots on the file pages.
 * - Large records are too big to fit on a slotted page, so they are put
 * elsewhere, and the slots point to these records.  Actually, what is
 * in a slot is a small array of page pointers to the data of the large record.
 * - A very large record is one whose slot in the file page contains
 *   a single reference to a page that is an index of data pages.
 *
 * Because records may take these forms, the API for creating records
 * contains the opportunity for you to provide a hint about the ultimate
 * size of the record so that the storage manager can create the proper
 * structure for the record immediately, rather than creating a small
 * record that is soon to be converted to a large, then a very large record
 * by subsequent appends. 
 *
 * All records contain a client-defined header.  This is for the convenience
 * of server-writers.  The header must fit on the slotted page, so it should
 * never be very large.
 *
 * The following methods manipulate files of records and the records found 
 * there.
 *
 * Modules below describe file traversal and
 * appending to files (\ref SSMSCANF), 
 * and pinning individual records in the buffer pool for extended operations 
 * (\ref SSMPIN).
 *
 * \section UNINIT Uninitialized Data
 * The functions create_rec, append_rec, and update_rec can be used to
 * write blocks of data that are all zeroes,  with minimal logging. 
 * This is useful for creating records of known size but with uninitialized data.  
 * The type zvec_t, a special case of vec_t, is for this purpose. 
 * Construct it with only a size, as follows:
 * \code
 * zvec_t zdata(100000);
 * \endcode
 * The underlying logging code recognizes that this is a vector of zeroes and
 * logs only a count, not the data themselves. 
 *
 * \section Errors
 * If an error occurs in the middle of one of these methods that is updating persistent data,
 * the record or file \e could be in an inconsistent state. 
 * The caller has the choice of aborting the transaction or rolling back to the nearest savepoint (see \ref SSMXCT).
 *
 * \sa SSMSCAN, SSMPIN, vec_t, zvec_t, IDs.

/**\defgroup SSMBTREE B+-Tree Indexes

 * to data by associating keys with values in 1:1 or many:1 relationships.
 * Keys may be compsed of any of the basic C-language types (integer,
 * unsigned, floating-point of several sizes) or
 * variable-length character strings (wide characters are \b not supported).
 *
 * The number of key-value pairs that an index can hold is limited by the
 * space available on the volume containing the index.

/**\defgroup SSMRTREE R*-Tree Indexes
 * \ingroup SSMSTG
 * An R-tree is a height-balanced structure designed for indexing
 * multi-dimensional spatial objects.  
 * It stores the minimial bounding box (with 2 or higher dimension) of a spatial
 * object as the key in the leaf pages.
 * This implementation is a variant of an R-Tree called an R*-Tree, which
 * improves the search performance by using a heuristic for redistributing
 * entries and dynamically reorganizing the tree during insertion.
 *
 * An R*-Tree stores key,value pairs where the key is of type nbox_t
 * and the value is of type vec_t.
 *
 * The number of key-value pairs an index can hold is limited by the space
 * available on the volume containing the index.
 * The minimum size of an R*-tree index is 8 pages.
 *
 * Bulk-loading is supported for this index.
 * 
 * \note This implementation 
 * uses coarse-grained (index-level) locking and 
 * supports only 2 dimensions and integer coordinates.
 * For information about R*-trees, see the \ref BKSS.

 * The thread may detach from the transaction and attach to another.
 * Multiple threads may attach to a single transaction and do work in certain circumstances.  
 * \todo Document what  mpl-threaded xcts may and may not do.
 *
 * All transactions are by default local. They may be created, 
 * aborted, or committed.
 *
 * A transaction may participate in a two-phase commit. The value-added server must provide the coordination, directly or indirectly, for the two-phase commit.
 * The storage manager supports preparing a local transaction for two-phase commit, and it will log the necessary data for recovering in-doubt transactions.

    // Below is most of the interface for the SHORE Storage Manager.

    //

    //
    // COMMON PARAMETERS
    //
    // vec_t  hdr:          data for the record header
    // vec_t  data:          data for the body of a record 
    // recsize_t len_hint:   approximately how long a record will be

    // TEMPORARY FILES/INDEXES
    //
    // When a file or index is created there is a tmp_flag parameter
    // that when true indicates that the file is temporary.
    // Operations on a temporary file are not logged and the

       Device and Volume Management
       ----------------------------
       A device is either an operating system file or operating system
       device and is identified by a path name (absolute or relative).
       A device has a quota.  In theory, a device may have 
       multiple volumes on it but
       in the current implementation the maximum number of volumes
       is 1.

       A volume is where data is stored.  A volume is identified
       uniquely and persistently by a long volume ID (lvid_t).
       Volumes can be used whenever the device they are located
       on is mounted by the SM.  Volumes have a quota.  The
       sum of the quotas of all the volumes on a device cannot
       exceed the device quota.

       The basic steps to begin using a new device/volume are:
        format_dev: initialize the device
        mount_dev: allow use of the device and all its volumes
        generate_new_lvid: generate a unique ID for the volume
        create_vol: create a volume on the device
